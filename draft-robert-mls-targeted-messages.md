--- abstract

MLS targeted messages allow sending encrypted messages to a specific member of
an MLS group.


--- middle

# Introduction

MLS application messages make sending encrypted messages to all group members
easy and efficient. Sometimes application protocols mandate that messages are
only sent to specific group members, either for privacy or for efficiency
reasons.

Targeted messages are a way to achieve this without having to create a new group
with the sender and the specific recipients â€“ which might not be possible or
desired. Instead, targeted messages define the format and encryption of a
message that is sent from a member of an existing group to another member of
that group.

The goal is to provide a one-shot messaging mechanism that provides
confidentiality and authentication, reusing mechanisms from {{!RFC9420}}, in
particular {{!RFC9180}}. Targeted messages can be used as a building block
for more complex messaging protocols.

# Authentication

A targeted message is authenticated by the sender's signature. The sender uses
the signature key of the its `LeafNode`. The signature scheme used is the
signature scheme specified in the cipher suite of the MLS group. The signature
is computed over the serialized `TargetedMessageTBS` struct and is included in
the `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.signature` field:

~~~ tls
signature = SignWithLabel(sender_leaf_node_signature_private_key,
              "TargetedMessageTBS", targeted_message_tbs)
~~~

The recipient MUST verify the signature:

~~~ tls
VerifyWithLabel.verify(sender_leaf_node.signature_key,
                       "TargetedMessageTBS",
                       targeted_message_tbs,
                       signature)
~~~

In addition, targeted messages are authenticated using a pre-shared key (PSK),
exported through the MLS exporter for the epoch specified in
SenderAuthDataAAD.epoch:

~~~ tls
targeted_message_psk =
  MLS-Exporter("targeted message", "psk", KDF.Nh)
~~~

The `targeted_message_psk` is used as the `psk` parameter to the HPKE encryption.
The corresponding `psk_id` parameter is the serialized `PSKId` struct.

## Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)

Targeted messages can include additional authenticated data (AAD) in the
`TargetedMessage.authenticated_data` field. This field is used to carry
application-specific data that is authenticated but not encrypted. The AAD is
included in the `TargetedMessagesTBM` struct.

# Encryption

Targeted messages uses HPKE to encrypt the message content between two leaves.

## Padding

The TargetedMessageContent.padding field is set by the sender, by first encoding
the application data and then appending the chosen number of zero bytes. A
receiver identifies the padding field in a plaintext decoded from
TargetedMessage.ciphertext by first decoding the application data; then the
padding field comprises any remaining octets of plaintext. The padding field
MUST be filled with all zero bytes. A receiver MUST verify that there are no
non-zero bytes in the padding field, and if this check fails, the enclosing
TargetedMessage MUST be rejected as malformed. This check ensures that the
padding process is deterministic, so that, for example, padding cannot be used
as a covert channel.

## Sender data encryption

In addition, `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData` is encrypted similarly to
`MLSSenderData` as described in {{Section 6.3.2 of !RFC9420}}. The
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.sender_leaf_index` field is the leaf index of the
sender. The `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.signature` field is the signature of
the `TargetedMessageTBS` structure. The
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.kem_output` field is the KEM output of the HPKE
encryption.

The key and nonce provided to the AEAD are computed as the KDF of the first
KDF.Nh bytes of the `ciphertext` generated in the following section. If the
length of the ciphertext is less than KDF.Nh, the whole ciphertext is
used. In pseudocode, the key and nonce are derived as:

~~~ tls
sender_auth_data_secret =
  MLS-Exporter("targeted message", "sender auth data secret", KDF.Nh)

ciphertext_sample = ciphertext[0..KDF.Nh-1]

sender_data_key = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret, "key",
                      ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nk)
sender_data_nonce = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret, "nonce",
                      ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nn)
~~~

The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) for the `SenderAuthData` ciphertext is
the first three fields of `TargetedMessage`:

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
} SenderAuthDataAAD;
~~~

## Application data encryption

The `TargetedMessageContent` struct contains the application data to be sent
to the recipient. The `application_data` field contains the application data
to be sent, and the `padding` field contains padding bytes to ensure that the
ciphertext is of a length that is a multiple of the AEAD tag length.

The `TargetedMessageContent` struct is serialized and then encrypted
using HPKE.

The HPKE context is a TargetedMessageContext struct with the
following content, where `group_context` is the serialized context of the MLS
group:

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque label<V>;
  opaque context<V>;
} TargetedMessageContext;

label = "MLS 1.0 TargetedMessageData"
context = group_context
~~~

The TargetedMessageContext struct is serialized as hpke_context and is used by
both the sender and the recipient. The recipient's leaf node HPKE encryption key
from the MLS group is used as the recipient's public key
`recipient_node_public_key` for the HPKE encryption.

The `TargetedMessageTBM` struct is serialized as `targeted_message_tbm`, an is
used as the `aad` parameter for the HPKE encryption.

The sender computes `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.kem_output and
`TargetedMessage.ciphertext`:

~~~ tls
(kem_output, ciphertext) = SealPSK(
                                        /* pkR */
                                        recipient_node_public_key,
                                        /* info */
                                        hpke_context,
                                        /* aad */
                                        targeted_message_tbm,
                                        /* pt */
                                        targeted_message_content,
                                        /* psk */
                                        targeted_message_psk,
                                        /* psk_id */
                                        psk_id)
~~~

The recipient decrypts the content as follows:

~~~ tls
targeted_message_content = OpenPSK(kem_output,
                  receiver_node_private_key,
                  hpke_context,
                  targeted_message_tbm,
                  ciphertext,
                  targeted_message_psk,
                  psk_id)
~~~

The functions `SealPSK` and `OpenPSK` are defined in {{!RFC9180}}.

# Security Considerations

In addition to the sender authentication, Targeted Messages are authenticated by
using a pre-shared key (PSK) between the sender and the recipient. The PSK is
exported from the group key schedule using the label "targeted message psk".
This ensures that the PSK is only valid for a specific group and epoch, and the
Forward Secrecy and Post-Compromise Security guarantees of the group key
schedule apply to the targeted messages as well. The PSK also ensures that an
attacker needs access to the private group state in addition to the
HPKE/signature's private keys. This improves confidentiality guarantees against
passive attackers and authentication guarantees against active attackers.`
