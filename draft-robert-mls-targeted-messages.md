--- abstract

MLS targeted messages allow sending encrypted messages to a specific member of
an MLS group.

# Introduction

MLS application messages make sending encrypted messages to all group members
easy and efficient. Sometimes application protocols mandate that messages are
only sent to specific group members, either for privacy or for efficiency
reasons.

Targeted messages are a way to achieve this without having to create a new group
with the sender and the specific recipients – which might not be possible or
desired. Instead, targeted messages define the format and encryption of a
message that is sent from a member of an existing group to another member of
that group.

The goal is to provide a one-shot messaging mechanism that provides
confidentiality and authentication, reusing mechanisms from {{!RFC9420}}, in
particular {{!RFC9180}}. Targeted messages can be used as a building block
for more complex messaging protocols.

# Format

This extension defines the `mls_targeted_message` WireFormat, where the content
is a `TargetedMessage`.

A `TargetedMessage` is carried in the `MLSMessage` envelope defined in
{{Section 6 of !RFC9420}}:

~~~ tls
case mls_targeted_message:
    TargetedMessage targeted_message;
~~~

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  opaque encrypted_sender_auth_data<V>;
  opaque ciphertext<V>;
} TargetedMessage;

struct {
  uint32 sender_leaf_index;
  opaque signature<V>;
  opaque kem_output<V>;
} TargetedMessageSenderAuthData;

struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  TargetedMessageSenderAuthData sender_auth_data;
} TargetedMessageTBM;

struct {
  ProtocolVersion version = mls10;
  WireFormat wire_format = mls_targeted_message;
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  uint32 sender_leaf_index;
  opaque kem_output<V>;
} TargetedMessageTBS;

struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  opaque label<V> = "MLS 1.0 targeted message psk";
} PSKId;

struct {
   opaque application_data<V>;
   opaque padding[length_of_padding];
} TargetedMessageContent;
~~~

# Authentication

A targeted message is authenticated by the sender's signature. The sender uses
the signature key of the its `LeafNode`. The signature scheme used is the
signature scheme specified in the cipher suite of the MLS group. The signature
is computed over the serialized `TargetedMessageTBS` struct and is included in
the `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.signature` field:

~~~ tls
signature = SignWithLabel(sender_leaf_node_signature_private_key,
              "TargetedMessageTBS", targeted_message_tbs)
~~~

The recipient MUST verify the signature:

~~~ tls
VerifyWithLabel(sender_leaf_node.signature_key,
                "TargetedMessageTBS",
                targeted_message_tbs,
                signature)
~~~

In addition, targeted messages are authenticated using a pre-shared key (PSK),
exported through the MLS exporter for the epoch specified in
SenderAuthDataAAD.epoch:

~~~ tls
targeted_message_psk =
  MLS-Exporter("targeted message", "psk", KDF.Nh)
~~~

The `targeted_message_psk` is used as the `psk` parameter to the HPKE encryption.
The corresponding `psk_id` parameter is the serialized `PSKId` struct.

## Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)

Targeted messages can include additional authenticated data (AAD) in the
`TargetedMessage.authenticated_data` field. This field is used to carry
application-specific data that is authenticated but not encrypted. The AAD is
included in the `TargetedMessagesTBM` struct.

# Encryption

Targeted messages uses HPKE to encrypt the message content between two leaves.

Unlike the HPKE Base mode used in {{!RFC9420}}, targeted messages use HPKE PSK
mode ({{Section 5.1.3 of !RFC9180}}). The PSK is derived from the MLS group key
schedule, binding the encryption to the group state and providing authentication
that the sender holds the group's PSK.

## Padding

The TargetedMessageContent.padding field is set by the sender, by first encoding
the application data and then appending the chosen number of zero bytes. A
receiver identifies the padding field in a plaintext decoded from
TargetedMessage.ciphertext by first decoding the application data; then the
padding field comprises any remaining octets of plaintext. The padding field
MUST be filled with all zero bytes. A receiver MUST verify that there are no
non-zero bytes in the padding field, and if this check fails, the enclosing
TargetedMessage MUST be rejected as malformed. This check ensures that the
padding process is deterministic, so that, for example, padding cannot be used
as a covert channel.

## Sender data encryption

In addition, `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData` is encrypted similarly to
`MLSSenderData` as described in {{Section 6.3.2 of !RFC9420}}. The
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.sender_leaf_index` field is the leaf index of the
sender. The `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.signature` field is the signature of
the `TargetedMessageTBS` structure. The
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.kem_output` field is the KEM output of the HPKE
encryption.

The key and nonce provided to the AEAD are computed as the KDF of the first
KDF.Nh bytes of the `ciphertext` generated in the following section. If the
length of the ciphertext is less than KDF.Nh, the whole ciphertext is
used. In pseudocode, the key and nonce are derived as:

~~~ tls
sender_auth_data_secret =
  MLS-Exporter("targeted message", "sender auth data secret", KDF.Nh)

ciphertext_sample = ciphertext[0..KDF.Nh-1]

sender_data_key = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret, "key",
                      ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nk)
sender_data_nonce = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret, "nonce",
                      ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nn)
~~~

The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) for the `SenderAuthData` ciphertext is
the first three fields of `TargetedMessage`:

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
} SenderAuthDataAAD;
~~~

## Application data encryption

The `TargetedMessageContent` struct contains the application data to be sent
to the recipient. The `application_data` field contains the application data
to be sent, and the `padding` field contains padding bytes to ensure that the
ciphertext is of a length that is a multiple of the AEAD tag length.

The `TargetedMessageContent` struct is serialized and then encrypted
using HPKE.

The HPKE context is a TargetedMessageContext struct with the
following content, where `group_context` is the serialized context of the MLS
group:

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque label<V>;
  opaque context<V>;
} TargetedMessageContext;

label = "MLS 1.0 TargetedMessageData"
context = group_context
~~~

The `TargetedMessageContext` struct follows the same structure as `EncryptContext`
in {{Section 5.1.3 of !RFC9420}}, but uses PSK mode rather than Base mode.

The TargetedMessageContext struct is serialized as hpke_context and is used by
both the sender and the recipient. The recipient's leaf node HPKE encryption key
from the MLS group is used as the recipient's public key
`recipient_node_public_key` for the HPKE encryption.

The `TargetedMessageTBM` struct is serialized as `targeted_message_tbm`, an is
used as the `aad` parameter for the HPKE encryption.

The sender computes `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.kem_output and
`TargetedMessage.ciphertext`:

~~~ tls
(kem_output, ciphertext) = SealPSK(
                                        /* pkR */
                                        recipient_node_public_key,
                                        /* info */
                                        hpke_context,
                                        /* aad */
                                        targeted_message_tbm,
                                        /* pt */
                                        targeted_message_content,
                                        /* psk */
                                        targeted_message_psk,
                                        /* psk_id */
                                        psk_id)
~~~

The recipient decrypts the content as follows:

~~~ tls
targeted_message_content = OpenPSK(kem_output,
                  receiver_node_private_key,
                  hpke_context,
                  targeted_message_tbm,
                  ciphertext,
                  targeted_message_psk,
                  psk_id)
~~~

The functions `SealPSK` and `OpenPSK` are defined in {{!RFC9180}}.

# Recipient Validation

Upon receiving a `TargetedMessage`, the recipient MUST perform the following
validation steps:

- Verify that `group_id` matches a group the recipient is a member of.
- Verify that `epoch` corresponds to the current epoch or a past epoch for which
  the recipient still has the necessary key material.
- Verify that `recipient_leaf_index` matches the recipient's own leaf index in
  the specified epoch.
- After decrypting `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData`, verify that
  `sender_leaf_index` refers to a non-blank leaf in the ratchet tree of the
  specified epoch.
- Verify the signature as described in {{authentication}}.

The recipient MUST NOT process or act on the decrypted
`TargetedMessageContent` until all of the above validation steps have
completed successfully. In particular, the content MUST NOT be passed to
the application before the sender's signature has been verified.

If any of these checks fail, the `TargetedMessage` MUST be rejected.

# Security Considerations

This section describes the security properties of targeted messages and their
limitations relative to MLS application messages {{!RFC9420}}.

## Authentication

Targeted messages use two complementary authentication mechanisms. The sender's
signature ({{authentication}}) binds the message to the sender's identity:
the recipient verifies the signature against the sender's `LeafNode` signature
key, confirming that the holder of that key produced the message. The PSK
exported from the group key schedule provides a second layer that proves group
membership. Per {{Section 9.1 of !RFC9180}}, HPKE PSK mode provides outsider
authentication, ensuring that an entity that does not know the PSK cannot forge
a valid ciphertext. It does not, however, authenticate which PSK holder
produced the message. Sender identity relies entirely on the signature.

Because the PSK is derived from the MLS key schedule, it is only valid for a
specific group and epoch. The Forward Secrecy and Post-Compromise Security
guarantees of the group key schedule therefore extend to targeted messages. The
PSK also ensures that an attacker needs access to the private group state in
addition to the HPKE and signature private keys, improving confidentiality
guarantees against passive attackers and authentication guarantees against active
attackers.

## Signature Verification Before Processing

The decryption flow necessarily produces plaintext before the signature can be
verified: the recipient first decrypts the sender authentication data
({{sender-data-encryption}}) to obtain the sender's leaf index, KEM output,
and signature, then decrypts the HPKE ciphertext to obtain the
`TargetedMessageContent`, and finally verifies the signature over the
`TargetedMessageTBS` structure.

Because the PSK is shared among all group members and each member's HPKE
public key is available in the ratchet tree, any group member can construct
HPKE ciphertext that decrypts successfully while claiming a different sender
identity. The signature is the sole mechanism that binds the message to the
claimed sender. {{recipient-validation}} requires that the recipient not act on
the decrypted content until signature verification has succeeded.

## Forward Secrecy

Targeted messages encrypt directly to the recipient's leaf node HPKE encryption
key. Unlike application messages in {{!RFC9420}}, which derive per-message keys
from a secret tree, targeted messages have no per-message key derivation.
Compromising the recipient's leaf private key therefore exposes all targeted
messages encrypted to that key within the epoch. Forward secrecy is at epoch
granularity only: it depends on the key schedule advancing to a new epoch and on
the recipient deleting the previous epoch's leaf private key. Applications that
require stronger forward secrecy guarantees SHOULD advance the epoch frequently.

## Sender Identity Confidentiality

The `sender_auth_data_secret` used to encrypt the
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData` is derived from the MLS exporter
({{sender-data-encryption}}) and is available to all group members. Sender
identity is therefore protected from the Delivery Service and from entities
outside the group, but not from other group members who obtain the encrypted
message.

## Replay Protection

Targeted messages do not include a generation counter or nonce at the protocol
level. A captured targeted message can therefore be replayed within the same
epoch and will pass all validation checks. However, targeted messages are a
stateless one-shot mechanism: replaying a message causes the recipient to see
duplicate content but does not change any group state. Applications that require
replay detection SHOULD include a unique nonce in the `authenticated_data`
field and track previously seen values.
