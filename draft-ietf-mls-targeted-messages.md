--- abstract

This document defines targeted messages for the Messaging Layer Security
(MLS) protocol. A targeted message allows a member of an MLS group to
send an encrypted and authenticated message to another member of the same
group without creating a new group. The mechanism reuses Hybrid Public Key
Encryption (HPKE) and the MLS key schedule to provide confidentiality,
authentication, and binding to the group state.

# Introduction

MLS application messages make sending encrypted messages to all group members
easy and efficient. Sometimes application protocols require that a group member
sends a message only to specific members of the same group, either for privacy
or for efficiency reasons.

Targeted messages are a way to achieve this without having to create a new group
with the sender and the specific recipients, which might not be possible or
desired. Instead, this document defines the format and encryption of a message
that is sent from a member of an existing group to another member of that group.

The goal is to provide a one-shot messaging mechanism offering confidentiality
and authentication, reusing mechanisms from {{!RFC9420}} and {{!RFC9180}}.
Targeted messages can be used as a building block for more complex messaging
protocols.

# Format

This document defines the `mls_targeted_message` WireFormat, where the content
is a `TargetedMessage`.

A `TargetedMessage` is carried in the `MLSMessage` envelope defined in
{{Section 6 of !RFC9420}}:

~~~ tls
case mls_targeted_message:
    TargetedMessage targeted_message;
~~~

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  opaque encrypted_sender_auth_data<V>;
  opaque ciphertext<V>;
} TargetedMessage;

struct {
  uint32 sender_leaf_index;
  opaque signature<V>;
  opaque kem_output<V>;
} TargetedMessageSenderAuthData;

struct {
  ProtocolVersion version = mls10;
  WireFormat wire_format = mls_targeted_message;
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  uint32 sender_leaf_index;
  opaque kem_output<V>;
  opaque ciphertext_hash<V>;
} TargetedMessageTBS;

struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  opaque label<V> = "MLS 1.0 targeted message psk";
} PSKId;

struct {
  opaque application_data<V>;
  opaque padding[length_of_padding];
} TargetedMessageContent;
~~~

# Cryptographic Algorithms

All cryptographic operations on a targeted message use the cipher suite of
the MLS group in which the message is sent ({{Section 5.1 of !RFC9420}}). In
particular, the group's cipher suite determines:

- the KEM, KDF, and AEAD used for the HPKE encryption of the message content
  ({{application-data-encryption}}),
- the KDF underlying the `MLS-Exporter` and `ExpandWithLabel` derivations
  ({{authentication}} and {{sender-data-encryption}}), including the value
  `KDF.Nh`,
- the AEAD used to encrypt the sender authentication data
  ({{sender-data-encryption}}), including the values `AEAD.Nk` and `AEAD.Nn`,
- the hash function used to compute `ciphertext_hash`
  ({{authentication}}), and
- the signature algorithm used to sign and verify the `TargetedMessageTBS`
  struct ({{authentication}}).

# Authentication

A targeted message is authenticated by the sender's signature. The sender uses
the signature key of its `LeafNode`. The signature scheme is determined by the
cipher suite of the MLS group. The signature
is computed over the serialized `TargetedMessageTBS` struct and is included in
the `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.signature` field:

~~~ tls
signature = SignWithLabel(sender_leaf_node_signature_private_key,
              "TargetedMessageTBS", targeted_message_tbs)
~~~

The `ciphertext_hash` field of `TargetedMessageTBS` is computed over the
`TargetedMessage.ciphertext` field with the hash function of the group's
cipher suite:

~~~ tls
ciphertext_hash = Hash(ciphertext)
~~~

Covering the ciphertext hash binds the signature to the encrypted message
content.

The recipient MUST verify the signature:

~~~ tls
VerifyWithLabel(sender_leaf_node.signature_key,
                "TargetedMessageTBS",
                targeted_message_tbs,
                signature)
~~~

In addition, targeted messages are authenticated using a pre-shared key (PSK),
exported through the MLS exporter for the epoch specified in the
`TargetedMessage`:

~~~ tls
targeted_message_psk =
  MLS-Exporter("targeted message", "psk", KDF.Nh)
~~~

The `targeted_message_psk` is used as the `psk` parameter in the Hybrid
Public Key Encryption (HPKE) encryption.
The corresponding `psk_id` parameter is the serialized `PSKId` struct.

## Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)

Targeted messages can include additional authenticated data (AAD) in the
`TargetedMessage.authenticated_data` field. This field is used to carry
application-specific data that is authenticated but not encrypted. The content
of this field is used as the `aad` parameter of the HPKE encryption
({{application-data-encryption}}).

# Encryption

Targeted messages use HPKE to encrypt the message content to a specific group
member.

Unlike the HPKE Base mode used in {{!RFC9420}}, targeted messages use HPKE PSK
mode ({{Section 5.1.2 of !RFC9180}}). The PSK is derived from the MLS group key
schedule, binding the encryption to the group state and providing authentication
that the sender holds the group's PSK.

## Padding

The `TargetedMessageContent.padding` field is set by the sender, by first
encoding the application data and then appending the chosen number of zero
bytes. A receiver identifies the `padding` field in a plaintext decoded from
`TargetedMessage.ciphertext` by first decoding the application data; then the
`padding` field comprises any remaining octets of plaintext. The `padding`
field MUST be filled with all zero bytes. A receiver MUST verify that there
are no non-zero bytes in the `padding` field, and if this check fails, the
enclosing `TargetedMessage` MUST be rejected as malformed. This check ensures
that the padding process is deterministic, so that, for example, padding
cannot be used as a covert channel.

## Application Data Encryption

The `TargetedMessageContent` struct is serialized and encrypted using HPKE.

The HPKE context is a `TargetedMessageContext` struct with the
following content:

~~~ tls
struct {
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  uint32 sender_leaf_index;
} TargetedMessageContextData;

struct {
  opaque label<V> = "MLS 1.0 TargetedMessageData";
  TargetedMessageContextData context;
} TargetedMessageContext;
~~~

The `TargetedMessageContext` struct follows the same convention as
`EncryptContext` in {{Section 5.1.3 of !RFC9420}}, a label followed by
application context. Unlike `EncryptContext`, the `context` field is typed
rather than opaque, and the encryption uses PSK mode rather than Base mode.
The `context` field binds the encryption to the recipient and sender leaf
indices. The message is bound to the group state through the
`targeted_message_psk`, as described in {{group-state-binding}}.

The `TargetedMessageContext` struct is serialized as `hpke_context` and is used
by both the sender and the recipient. The recipient's leaf node HPKE encryption
key from the ratchet tree of the epoch specified in the `TargetedMessage` is
used as the recipient's public key `recipient_node_public_key` for the HPKE
encryption.

The content of the `TargetedMessage.authenticated_data` field is used as the
`aad` parameter for the HPKE encryption. The sender uses the single-shot
`SealPSK` API:

~~~ tls
(kem_output, ciphertext) = SealPSK(recipient_node_public_key,
                                   hpke_context,
                                   authenticated_data,
                                   targeted_message_content,
                                   targeted_message_psk,
                                   psk_id)
~~~

In full, the sender performs the following steps in order:

 - Derive the `targeted_message_psk` ({{authentication}}) and the
   `sender_auth_data_secret` ({{sender-data-encryption}}).
 - Compute `kem_output` and `ciphertext` by calling `SealPSK` with the
   serialized `TargetedMessageContent` as plaintext.
 - Compute `ciphertext_hash` from `ciphertext`, construct the
   `TargetedMessageTBS` struct, and compute the `signature` as described in
   {{authentication}}.
 - Assemble the `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData` struct from
   `sender_leaf_index`, `signature`, and `kem_output`, and encrypt it as
   described in {{sender-data-encryption}}, using a sample of the `ciphertext`
   computed above.

The `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.kem_output` field is set to `kem_output`,
and the `TargetedMessage.ciphertext` field is set to `ciphertext`.

The recipient learns the `kem_output` and the `sender_leaf_index` by
decrypting `encrypted_sender_auth_data` before decrypting the content. The
`sender_leaf_index` is needed to construct the `TargetedMessageContextData`
struct:

~~~ tls
targeted_message_content = OpenPSK(kem_output,
                  recipient_node_private_key,
                  hpke_context,
                  authenticated_data,
                  ciphertext,
                  targeted_message_psk,
                  psk_id)
~~~

The functions `SealPSK` and `OpenPSK` are defined in {{Section 6.1 of
!RFC9180}}.

## Sender Data Encryption

`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData` is encrypted similarly to `MLSSenderData` as
described in {{Section 6.3.2 of !RFC9420}}. It contains the sender's leaf
index, the signature over `TargetedMessageTBS`, and the Key Encapsulation
Mechanism (KEM) output of the HPKE encryption.

The key and nonce provided to the Authenticated Encryption with Associated
Data (AEAD) are computed as the Key Derivation Function (KDF) of the first
KDF.Nh bytes of the `ciphertext` generated in {{application-data-encryption}}.
If the length of the ciphertext is less than KDF.Nh, the whole ciphertext is
used. As with the `targeted_message_psk`, the `sender_auth_data_secret` is
exported from the key schedule of the epoch specified in the
`TargetedMessage`. In pseudocode, the key and nonce are derived as:

~~~ tls
sender_auth_data_secret =
  MLS-Exporter("targeted message", "sender auth data secret", KDF.Nh)

ciphertext_sample = ciphertext[0..KDF.Nh-1]

sender_auth_data_key = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret,
                           "key", ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nk)
sender_auth_data_nonce = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret,
                             "nonce", ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nn)
~~~

The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) for the `encrypted_sender_auth_data`
ciphertext is the first three fields of `TargetedMessage`:

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
} SenderAuthDataAAD;
~~~

# Recipient Validation

Upon receiving a `TargetedMessage`, the recipient MUST perform the following
steps in order:

 - Verify that `group_id` matches a group the recipient is a member of.
 - Verify that `epoch` corresponds to the current epoch of that group, or to a
   past epoch for which the recipient still has the necessary key material
   ({{messages-from-past-epochs}}).
 - Verify that `recipient_leaf_index` matches the recipient's own leaf index
   in the specified epoch.
 - Decrypt `encrypted_sender_auth_data` as described in
   {{sender-data-encryption}} and verify that `sender_leaf_index` refers to a
   non-blank leaf in the ratchet tree of the specified epoch.
 - Compute `ciphertext_hash` from `TargetedMessage.ciphertext` and verify the
   signature as described in {{authentication}}.
 - Decrypt `ciphertext` as described in {{application-data-encryption}}.
 - Verify that the `padding` field of the decrypted `TargetedMessageContent`
   contains only zero bytes, as described in {{padding}}.

The signature MUST be verified before `ciphertext` is decrypted. The
`TargetedMessageTBS` struct covers the `ciphertext` only through its hash,
which the recipient computes from the wire-format `ciphertext` field, so
signature verification does not depend on the decrypted content. Verifying
first ensures that no plaintext is produced from a message whose claimed
sender has not been authenticated. The decrypted `TargetedMessageContent`
MUST NOT be passed to the application before all of the above steps have
completed successfully.

If any of these steps fails, the `TargetedMessage` MUST be rejected.

## Messages from Past Epochs

Processing a `TargetedMessage` for a past epoch requires the recipient to
retain the following key material and state for that epoch:

- the exporter secret, or the `targeted_message_psk` and
  `sender_auth_data_secret` derived from it,
- the recipient's leaf node HPKE private key, and
- the leaf nodes of the ratchet tree, in order to look up the sender's leaf
  node.

Support for past epochs is OPTIONAL, accepting only the current epoch is the
most conservative behavior. Retaining key material from past epochs weakens
the Forward Secrecy properties described in {{forward-secrecy}}: targeted
messages for an epoch remain decryptable for as long as that epoch's key
material exists. Applications that accept messages from past epochs SHOULD
bound the number of retained epochs and SHOULD delete the corresponding key
material as soon as it is no longer needed.

# Security Considerations

This section describes the security properties of targeted messages and their
limitations relative to MLS application messages {{!RFC9420}}.

## Authentication

Targeted messages use two complementary authentication mechanisms. The sender's
signature ({{authentication}}) binds the message to the sender's identity:
the recipient verifies the signature against the sender's `LeafNode` signature
key, confirming that the holder of that key produced the message. The PSK
exported from the group key schedule provides a second layer that proves group
membership. Per {{Section 9.1 of !RFC9180}}, HPKE PSK mode provides outsider
authentication, ensuring that an entity that does not know the PSK cannot forge
a valid ciphertext. It does not, however, authenticate which PSK holder
produced the message. Sender identity relies entirely on the signature.

Because the PSK is derived from the MLS key schedule, it is only valid for a
specific group and epoch. The Forward Secrecy and Post-Compromise Security
guarantees of the group key schedule therefore extend to targeted messages. The
PSK also ensures that an attacker needs access to the private group state in
addition to the HPKE and signature private keys, improving confidentiality
guarantees against passive attackers and authentication guarantees against active
attackers.

## Group State Binding

Targeted messages are bound to the group state through the
`targeted_message_psk`. The key schedule of {{!RFC9420}} injects the
serialized `GroupContext` into the derivation of each epoch's secrets, so the
exporter-derived PSK commits to the full group state of the specified epoch,
including the tree hash and the confirmed transcript hash.

## Message Field Binding

The HPKE encryption is bound to the fields of a targeted message at one or
more layers. The `group_id` and `epoch` are bound through the `psk_id` and
through the epoch-derived PSK, both of which enter the HPKE key schedule. The
leaf indices of the recipient and the sender are bound through the HPKE `info`
input, which carries the `TargetedMessageContextData` struct. The
`authenticated_data` field is authenticated directly as the HPKE `aad`
parameter. The `kem_output` is bound through the HPKE key schedule, which
derives the encryption keys from the KEM shared secret. For the DHKEM variants
used by the cipher suites of {{!RFC9420}}, the shared-secret derivation also
includes the `kem_output` itself. Independently of these HPKE-layer bindings,
the sender's signature over the `TargetedMessageTBS` struct covers all of the
fields above together with the hash of the ciphertext.

## Signature Verification Before Processing

Because the PSK is shared among all group members and each member's HPKE
public key is available in the ratchet tree, any group member can construct
HPKE ciphertext that decrypts successfully while claiming a different sender
identity. The signature is the sole mechanism that binds the message to the
claimed sender.

The `TargetedMessageTBS` structure covers the `kem_output` and a hash of the
`ciphertext`, both of which are available before content decryption: the
former from the decrypted sender authentication data
({{sender-data-encryption}}), the latter from the wire format itself.
{{recipient-validation}} therefore requires the recipient to verify the
signature before decrypting the HPKE ciphertext, ensuring that plaintext is
never produced from a message whose claimed sender has not been
authenticated.

## Forward Secrecy

Targeted messages encrypt directly to the recipient's leaf node HPKE encryption
key. Unlike application messages in {{!RFC9420}}, which derive per-message keys
from a secret tree, targeted messages have no per-message key derivation.
Compromising the recipient's leaf private key therefore exposes all targeted
messages encrypted to that key within the epoch. Forward secrecy is at epoch
granularity only: it depends on the key schedule advancing to a new epoch and on
the recipient deleting the previous epoch's leaf private key. Applications that
require stronger forward secrecy guarantees SHOULD advance the epoch frequently.
Accepting targeted messages from past epochs requires retaining old key
material and further weakens forward secrecy, as described in
{{messages-from-past-epochs}}.

## Sender Identity Confidentiality

The `sender_auth_data_secret` used to encrypt the
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData` is derived from the MLS exporter
({{sender-data-encryption}}) and is available to all group members. Sender
identity is therefore protected from the Delivery Service and from entities
outside the group, but not from other group members who obtain the encrypted
message.

The encryption mechanism is the same as the one used for `MLSSenderData` in
{{Section 6.3.2 of !RFC9420}}, and the analysis of {{Section 16.3 of
!RFC9420}} applies equally to targeted messages. In particular, using the
same `sender_auth_data_secret` with the same ciphertext sample more than once
would reuse an AEAD key and nonce pair; with the AEAD algorithms of the
cipher suites defined in {{!RFC9420}}, the probability of two ciphertext
samples colliding is no more than 2^-128.

## Replay Protection

Targeted messages do not include a generation counter or nonce at the protocol
level. A captured targeted message can therefore be replayed within the same
epoch and will pass all validation checks. However, targeted messages are a
stateless one-shot mechanism: replaying a message causes the recipient to see
duplicate content but does not change any group state. Applications that require
replay detection SHOULD include a unique nonce in the `authenticated_data`
field and track previously seen values.

# Test Vectors

The following test vectors exercise the receiver-side processing described in
{{recipient-validation}}. Because the HPKE encapsulation is randomized, the
sender-side operations are not reproducible from the inputs alone; sender
implementations can be tested by round-tripping against a receiver
implementation.

All vectors use the MTI MLS cipher suite
MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519. All values except `cipher_suite`,
`epoch`, the leaf indices, and `padding_length` (all decimal) are hex-encoded.

Each vector provides the group state held by the recipient:

- `group_id` and `epoch`: the group and epoch the message belongs to.
- `exporter_secret`: the exporter secret of that epoch, from which the
  `targeted_message_psk` and the `sender_auth_data_secret` are derived
  ({{authentication}} and {{sender-data-encryption}}).
- `sender_leaf_index` and `sender_leaf_node`: the sender's leaf index and
  serialized `LeafNode`, which provides the signature public key.
- `recipient_leaf_index` and `recipient_encryption_priv`: the recipient's
  leaf index and leaf node HPKE private key.

as well as the message and its expected plaintext:

- `targeted_message`: a serialized `MLSMessage` with the
  `mls_targeted_message` WireFormat, containing the `TargetedMessage`.
- `authenticated_data`: the expected content of the
  `TargetedMessage.authenticated_data` field.
- `application_data`: the expected application data after decryption.
- `padding_length`: the expected length of the zero-filled `padding` field of
  the decrypted `TargetedMessageContent`.

A verifier performs the steps of {{recipient-validation}} on
`targeted_message` and checks that all validation steps succeed, that the
decrypted application data matches `application_data`, and that the padding
has length `padding_length`.

# Change Log
{:removeInRFC="true"}

draft-ietf-mls-targeted-messages-02:

- Replaced the `TargetedMessageTBM` struct with the
  `TargetedMessageContextData` struct, which carries the leaf indices and is
  used as the `context` field of the HPKE info.
- Used the content of the `authenticated_data` field directly as the HPKE
  `aad` parameter.
- Replaced the two-step `SetupPSKS` and `Context.Seal` flow with the
  single-shot `SealPSK` API, which is possible now that the AAD no longer
  depends on the `kem_output`.
- Added a security consideration describing how each message field is bound.
- Updated the test vectors.

draft-ietf-mls-targeted-messages-01:

- Changed the intended status from Informational to Standards Track.
- Added a `ciphertext_hash` field to `TargetedMessageTBS` so that the
  signature covers the message content; `TargetedMessageTBM` now carries
  `sender_leaf_index` and `kem_output` directly.
- Replaced the single-shot `SealPSK` call with `SetupPSKS` followed by
  `Context.Seal`, and specified the full sender-side order of operations.
- Specified the recipient-side processing steps, including signature
  verification before content decryption.
- Emptied the `context` field of `TargetedMessageContext`; the group state
  binding is provided by the PSK, as described in the new Group State
  Binding security consideration.
- Added a Cryptographic Algorithms section binding all operations to the
  group's cipher suite.
- Bound the recipient's public key and the exported secrets to the epoch
  specified in the message, and added a Messages from Past Epochs section.
- Referenced the analysis of sender data encryption from RFC 9420 in the
  security considerations.
- Registered the "TargetedMessageData" MLS Public Key Encryption Label.
- Added a Test Vectors appendix.
- Editorial fixes: corrected the RFC 9180 section reference for PSK mode and
  aligned the IANA wire format description with the single-recipient design.
